# NeuroSim: AI-Augmented Brain Simulation Framework

## Overview
NeuroSim is an advanced neural simulation framework that combines finite element modeling (FEM) and deep learning to predict brain tissue behavior in real-time. This framework integrates physics-based simulations with neural networks, allowing for 10x faster simulations compared to traditional solvers. It is specifically designed for neuroscience research and brain-machine interface (BMI) applications.

## Features
- **Finite Element Modeling**: Uses FEM for brain tissue simulation to model stress, strain, and displacement in brain tissues.
- **Deep Learning Integration**: Implements a neural network to predict brain tissue behavior, enhancing real-time simulation speed and accuracy.
- **Real-time Predictions**: Provides accurate predictions of brain tissue behavior in a fraction of the time compared to traditional solvers.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch
- FEniCS (for finite element modeling)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeuroSim.git
